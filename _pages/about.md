======

I will start my postdoc at [BICMR](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/) in January 2025 supervised by [Yi Xie](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/content/lists/11_3.html).

In July 2024, I reveived my Ph.D. from Indiana University under the supervision of [Paul Kirk](https://pkirk.pages.iu.edu/).

I am interested in low dimensional topology, gauge theory, and differential geomerty. My current research is focusing on Lagrangian Fler theory, symplectic structures on 4-manifolds, and almost Kahler geometry.
